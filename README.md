This code creates a multilingual speech assistant that records audio, detects the language, transcribes the audio using Whisper, generates a response with GPT-4, and converts the response back into speech using Edge TTS. It automatically switches between languages (e.g., Urdu and English) based on the detected language in the audio. The assistant provides a seamless interaction for users, enabling voice input and output in multiple languages.
